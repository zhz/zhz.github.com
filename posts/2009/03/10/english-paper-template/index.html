<p>Case 1<br>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled “GDNF Acutely Modulates Neuronal Excitability and A-type Potassium Channels in Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons”, which we wish to be considered for publication in Nature Neuroscience.</p>
<p>GDNF has long been thought to be a potent neurotrophic factor for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which are degenerated in Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we report an unexpected, acute effect of GDNF on A-type potassium channels, leading to a potentiation of neuronal excitability, in the dopaminergic neurons in culture as well as in adult brain slices. Further, we show that GDNF regulates the K+ channels through a mechanism that involves activation of MAP kinase. Thus, this study has revealed, for the first time, an acute modulation of ion channels by GDNF. Our findings challenge the classic view of GDNF as a long-term survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and suggest that the normal function of GDNF is to regulate neuronal excitability, and consequently dopamine release. These results may also have implications in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>Due to a direct competition and conflict of interest, we request that Drs. XXX of Harvard Univ., and YY of Yale Univ. not be considered as reviewers. With thanks for your consideration, I am</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>case2<br>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled “Ca2+-binding protein frequenin mediates GDNF-induced potentiation of Ca2+ channels and transmitter release”, which we wish to be considered for publication in Neuron.</p>
<p>We believe that two aspects of this manuscript will make it interesting to general readers of Neuron. First, we report that GDNF has a long-term regulatory effect on neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular synapses. This provides the first physiological evidence for a role of this new family of neurotrophic factors in functional synaptic transmission. Second, we show that the GDNF effect is mediated by enhancing the expression of the Ca2+-binding protein frequenin. Further, GDNF and frequenin facilitate synaptic transmission by enhancing Ca2+ channel activity, leading to an enhancement of Ca2+ influx. Thus, this study has identified, for the first time, a molecular target that mediates the long-term, synaptic action of a neurotrophic factor. Our findings may also have general implications in the cell biology of neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>Case 3</p>
<p>Sample Cover Letter[the example used is the IJEB]<br>Dear Editor of the [please type in journal title or acronym]:</p>
<p>Enclosed is a paper, entitled “Mobile Agents for Network Management.” Please accept it as a candidate for publication in the [journal title]. Below are our responses to your submission requirements.</p>
<p>1. Title and the central theme of the article.</p>
<p>Paper title: “Mobile Agents for Network Management.” This study reviews the concepts of mobile agents and distributed network management system. It proposes a mobile agent-based implementation framework and creates a prototype system to demonstrate the superior performance of a mobile agent-based network over the conventional client-server architecture in a large network environment.</p>
<p>2. Which subject/theme of the Journal the material fits</p>
<p>New enabling technologies (if no matching subject/theme, enter ‘Subject highly related to [subject of journal] but not listed by [please type in journal title or acronym])</p>
<p>3. Why the material is important in its field and why the material should be published in [please type in journal title or acronym]?</p>
<p>The necessity of having an effective computer network is rapidly growing alongside the implementation of information technology. Finding an appropriate network management system has become increasingly important today’s distributed environment. However, the conventional centralized architecture, which routinely requests the status information of local units by the central server, is not sufficient to manage the growing requests. Recently, a new framework that uses mobile<br>agent technology to assist the distributed management has emerged. The mobile agent reduces network traffic, distributes management tasks, and improves operational performance. Given today’s bandwidth demand over the Internet, it is important for the [journal title/acronym] readers to understand this technology and its benefits. This study gives a real-life example of how to use mobile agents for distributed network management. It is the first in the literature that reports the analysis of network performance based on an operational prototype of mobile agent-based distributed<br>network. We strongly believe the contribution of this study warrants its publication in the [journal title/acronym].</p>

<p>PLoS Genetics（PLoS遗传学期刊）</p>
<p>I submit the accompanying manuscript entitled “Gain and loss of multiple genes during the evolution of Helicobacter pylori” by H. Gressmann et al. for publication in PLoS Genetics.</p>
<p>This manuscript presents the global variability within H. pylori in terms of presence or absence of almost all the genes within the two currently available genome sequences. The strains tested are representative of the global genetic diversity within H. pylori and also represent the diverse populations that exist in that organism. Global analyses of genomic content are very rare indeed for bacterial species and are new for H. pylori. By including isolates from the most closely related species, H. acinonychis, as an outgroup, it was possible to deduce that most variable genes were probably present in the last common ancestor of H. pylori and have subsequently been lost in individual isolates. In some cases, the same genes were lost in phylogenetically distinct groupings, reflecting convergent evolution. However, the cag PAI was acquired later, after subpopulations had formed. These conclusions are important for concepts about changes in gene content within species and for the acquisition of pathogenicity islands.</p>
<p>We also perform a head-to-head comparison of population structure indicated by whole genome microarrays versus that indicated by sequences of 7 housekeeping gene fragments. The comparison indicates that microarrays yield distorted population structures and are less suitable for this goal than simply sequencing 7 gene fragments. In order to be able to deduce patterns of gain or loss, it was necessary to have an independent population structure based on sequence diversity within core genes. This is an important conclusion because many laboratories are attempting to investigate bacterial population structure on the basis of microarray data on their own and have not realized that an independent population structure is necessary for such efforts..</p>
<p>The manuscript will be of great interest to the numerous scientists interested in infections caused by H. pylori as well as to scientists interested in microbial genomic structure and evolution.</p>
